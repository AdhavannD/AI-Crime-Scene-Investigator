Date: June 6th, 2025
Location: 17 Willow Creek Drive, suburban residence, 2-story villa
Victim: Dr. Alan Whitmore, age 50, forensic accountant, known whistleblower

At 10:05 PM, a neighbor called 911 reporting a loud bang and flickering lights at the Whitmore residence. Responding officers found Dr. Whitmore deceased in his home office on the second floor, slumped over his desk with a stab wound to the neck. Blood splatter indicates the attack was sudden and from behind. No signs of forced entry were observed, but the back door was unlocked.

Surveillance footage shows a person entering through the back gate at 9:47 PM wearing a long coat and gloves. No face was visible. The lights in the house flickered at 9:58 PM, possibly indicating a short circuit or tampering with the power. A partially burned document was found in the fireplace. The document appears to contain financial transaction logs involving offshore accounts.

A distinctive red fiber was found on the victim's sleeve, and a faint footprint (men’s size 9 boot) was noted near the office entrance. A glass of scotch was poured but untouched, suggesting the victim was interrupted.

Dr. Whitmore had recently submitted a report to federal investigators regarding embezzlement in a major defense contractor. He had received at least two anonymous threats in the past month, according to his secretary.
